# O(n) - Linear Time Complexity

O(n) represents linear time complexity, where the runtime of an algorithm grows directly proportional to the size of the input (n). As the input size grows, the time taken by the algorithm grows linearly.

## Characteristics
- Runtime grows linearly with input size
- If input size doubles, runtime doubles
- Usually involves iterating through an input exactly once
- Common in scenarios where you need to visit each element at least once

## Examples of O(n) Operations:
1. Array/List operations:
   - Finding an element in an unsorted array
   - Computing the sum of all elements
   - Finding the maximum/minimum value
   - Linear search

2. String operations:
   - Finding a character in a string
   - Reversing a string
   - Converting case (upper/lower)
   - Basic string validation

## Code Examples
```python
# Example 1: Finding sum of array elements
def sum_array(arr):
    total = 0
    for num in arr:  # O(n) - visits each element once
        total += num
    return total

# Example 2: Linear search
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):  # O(n) - may need to visit every element
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1

# Example 3: Finding maximum value
def find_max(arr):
    if not arr:
        return None
    max_val = arr[0]
    for num in arr:  # O(n) - must check every element
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
    return max_val
```

## Common Patterns to Recognize O(n):
1. Single loops through an array/list
2. Simple iteration through a string
3. Traversing a linked list
4. Processing each element exactly once

## When to Use O(n) Algorithms:
- When you need to process every element at least once
- When there's no way to solve the problem without looking at all inputs
- When the input is unsorted and you need to find something
- When building an initial data structure

## Space Complexity Consideration
O(n) algorithms might have different space complexities:
- O(1) space: when using just a few variables (like in sum_array)
- O(n) space: when creating a new data structure proportional to input size

## Best Practices
1. Use O(n) when you can't achieve O(1)
2. Look for ways to reduce constants (even though they don't affect Big O)
3. Consider whether preprocessing could help avoid O(n) operations
4. Be aware that multiple O(n) operations in sequence are still O(n)

## Real-World Analogies
Think of O(n) like:
- Reading a book page by page
- Checking each box in a line of boxes for a specific item
- Counting people in a line one by one

Remember: O(n) is often the best possible time complexity for many problems where you must examine each input element at least once.
