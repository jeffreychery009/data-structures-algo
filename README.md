# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice



This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms, serving as both a learning resource and a reference for future use.

## Purpose

This project is designed to:
- Implement fundamental data structures from scratch
- Practice common algorithmic problems and their solutions
- Demonstrate understanding of time and space complexity
- Provide clear examples of various programming concepts

## Structure

The codebase will be organized into the following main categories:

### Data Structures
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- Tries

### Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms
- Recursion and Backtracking

## Implementation Details

Each implementation will include:
- The core data structure/algorithm code
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Example usage
- Test cases
- Comments explaining the logic and approach
